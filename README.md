# prework-study-guide
## A summary on what Prework taught me.

In the process of creating this website, I've had to acquire a few new skills, and this guide shall help if I ever need to revisit the lessons. If you are reading this as someone who is looking at an example of what it could look like when you finish yours, feel free to email me with feedback, I'd love to hear from you @blastech1@outlook.com

## Future

As of the writing of the writing of this README, 10/23/22, there are still a few things I would like to achieve on this site before I decide I'm done, namely drop down menu's and making it look less like a website from 2002, but as of now I am not certain if I'm allowed to go over expectations as this is supposed to be for an educational project. Once I have submitted it and received feedback, there will be updates regarding said goals with timestamps for legibility.

## Usage

Open the website, read the allotted sections for what you want to learn. Make sure to use the inspect function to see what JavaScripts console.log has to say!
